    the digital enthusiast
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am in love with the way digital products are timeless, weightless, and are instantly available around the world.
      <br/>

      bringing them to life is not only a hobby but also a virtue

  classavo
  </h3>
  <p>
  My baby Classavo is an education platform that gives teachers vital intel on their students' learning progress.
  <br/>
  As I am raising Classavo, it also gives me back so much that I finally understand how grateful I am to be a father of a bunch of softwares!

  the purifier
  </h3>
  <p>
  The Purifier is my debut soundtrack album, exploring my interest in audible story telling. I released it for the subreddit r/filmmakers.
  <br/>
  All tracks are free for filmmakers around the world to use for their project, with no royalty or credits required.
  <br/>
  Something I definitely smile at night thinking about.
